Analyzing COVID-19 data using Python can help us understand the spread of the virus and its impact on various regions and populations.
This project aims to analyze the spread of COVID-19 using Python programming language. The project collects data from public sources and uses various Python libraries to preprocess, visualize, and analyze the data.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, you need to install the following Python libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly
Scikit-Learn
Folium
GeoPandas
PySAL
You can install these libraries using pip, a package installer for Python. Run the following command to install the libraries:
`pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn folium geopandas pysal`

## Usage
To use this project, you need to download the code from the GitHub repository. You can then run the Jupyter notebook file covid19_analysis.ipynb to preprocess, visualize, and analyze the COVID-19 data.

The notebook contains detailed instructions on how to use the Python libraries to perform data analysis. You can modify the code and adapt it to your needs.

## Data
The project uses publicly available COVID-19 data from sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University. The data is collected using web scraping techniques and cleaned using Pandas library.
